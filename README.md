### Hi, I'm Shashi Adhikari. 👋

<!--
**ShashiAdhikari/ShashiAdhikari** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
I graduated from the University of Dayton, Ohio, USA, in May 2021 with a major in Computer Science. As a machine learning enthusiast focusing on Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Science, I bring a solid foundation in these cutting-edge fields.

I have five years of experience as a software engineer. Currently, I work extensively with Azure Machine Learning, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Cognitive Services, combining my passion for machine learning with the power of cloud computing to develop innovative solutions.


🌱 I’m currently learning RASA, NLP, and how to write.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning projects.

🤔 I’m looking for contributions to the applied-ml repository.

💬 Ask me about Neural Network and how we can create the solution.
