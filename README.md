I graduated from the University of Dayton, Ohio, USA, in May 2021 with a major in Computer Science. As a machine learning enthusiast focusing on Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Science, I bring a solid foundation in these cutting-edge fields.

I have five years of experience as a software engineer. Currently, I work extensively with Azure Machine Learning, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Cognitive Services, combining my passion for machine learning with the power of cloud computing to develop innovative solutions.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NLP and how to create an AI Agent.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on deep learning projects.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for contributions to the applied-ml repository.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Neural Networks and how we can create the solution.
